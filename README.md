<h1>Mypataclone</h1>

My first good swim in JS libraries.
From the [Web Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) a [tutorial](https://patatapclonev.netlify.com/) was created based on the website [patap](https://patatap.com/). From there I wanted to give it a go and created my [version](https://myroughpatap.netlify.com/) that got nothing to do with it but was fun to work with libraries and try different things with it and learn from it

In all of them were used <em>howler.js</em> for the sound and <em>paper.js</em> for the animations and shapes.
